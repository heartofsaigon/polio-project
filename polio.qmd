## Q1: What is Polio?

- 1905-1908: discovered Polio was a highly infectious disease caused by any one of three types of poliovirus (by Ivar Wickman and Karl Landsteiner). 
- Invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
- The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route and multiplies in the intestine.
- Mainly affects children under 5 years of age.

## Q2: Why did polio terrify everyone?

*(Let us go to the 1950s...)*  

- The most inexplicable in its behavior.
- 6% of the deaths in the age group 5-9 in the 50s. 
- No prevention, no protection. 
- _"You cold be good parents or bad parents, and you still had no way to protect your child."_ 
- **1894**: 18 deaths + 132 paralyzed in the U.S;  
- **1916**: 2,000 dead in New York + 6,000 dead across the country and thousands more paralyzed; and...

## Q3: How did we fight against Polio in the past? (1/2) 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Solution**: Vaccine 
- **Goal**: Trial $\Rightarrow$ Vaccine $\Rightarrow$ antibodies.
- **Options**: live-virus (attenuated virus) VS. killed-virus (inactivated virus).
  - *Live-virus*: High level of long-lasting antibodies; however, cause vaccine-derived polioviruses, i.e. virus mutates into a virulent form and itself be the cause of paralytic or fatal disease.
  - *Killed-virus:* Safe, but fail to give rise to antibodies.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Criticism**: Can killed-viruses be the antigen? can it have long-lasting antibodies?
- **Trial Design**:**Trial Design**: Observed control VS. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled.  
  - *Observed control*: insufficiently convincing: (i) uncertainty in the diagnostic process, (ii) liability to influence by the physician's expectation, (iii) selective effect of using volunteers.
  - *Placebo control*: avoid all above bias.

## Q3: How did we fight against Polio in the past? (2/2) 

Was it really 90%?

Dr. Hanley will tell you the story behind this result. 

## [Q4: Does polio still exist? (1/2)](https://ourworldindata.org/polio)

- WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988.
- By 1999, 99% reduction of polio cases, eradicated wild poliovirus type 2, and all polioviruses from 3 of the 6 WHO regions. 
- Mid-2003, two Nigerian states suspended oral (attenuated) poliovirus vaccine use, which caused new outbreaks in 20 polio-free countries and thousands of children being paralyzed.

## Q5: What is the relation between Polio and COVID?

Question: Do you believe Vaccination With Oral Polio Vaccine Reduces COVID-19 Incidence?
