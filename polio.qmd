## Agenda

1. What is Poliomyelitis (Polio)? 
2. Why did it terrify everyone?
3. How did we fight against Polio in the past? 
4. Does polio still exist?
5. What is the relation between Polio and COVID?

Let us go back to the 1900...

## Q1: What is Polio?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- 1905-1908: discovered Polio was a highly infectious disease caused by any one of three types of poliovirus (by Ivar Wickman and Karl Landsteiner). 
- Invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
- The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route and multiplies in the intestine.
- Mainly affects children under 5 years of age.

## Q2: Why did it terrify everyone? 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- The most inexplicable in its behavior.
- 6% of the deaths in the age group 5-9 in the 50s. 
- No prevention, no protection. 
- _"You cold be good parents or bad parents, and you still had no way to protect your child."_ 
- **1894**: 18 deaths + 132 paralyzed in the U.S;  
- **1916**: 2,000 dead in New York + 6,000 dead across the country and thousands more paralyzed; and...

## Q3: How did we fight against Polio in the past? 

(Let us go to the 1950s...)  


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Solution**: Vaccine 
- **Goal**: Trial $\Rightarrow$ Vaccine $\Rightarrow$ antibodies.
- **Options**: live-virus (attenuated virus) VS. killed-virus (inactivated virus).
  - *Live-virus*: High level of long-lasting antibodies; however, cause vaccine-derived polioviruses, i.e. virus mutates into a virulent form and itself be the cause of paralytic or fatal disease.
  - *Killed-virus:* Safe, but fail to give rise to antibodies.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- **Criticism**: Can killed-viruses be the antigen? can it have long-lasting antibodies?
- **Trial Design**:**Trial Design**: Observed control VS. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled.  
  - *Observed control*: insufficiently convincing: (i) uncertainty in the diagnostic process, (ii) liability to influence by the physician's expectation, (iii) selective effect of using volunteers.
  - *Placebo control*: avoid all above bias.
