## Q1: What is Polio? {.smaller .r-fit-text}

- 1905-1908: discovered Polio was a highly infectious disease caused by any one of three types of poliovirus (by Ivar Wickman and Karl Landsteiner). 
- Invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
- The virus is transmitted by person-to-person spread mainly through the faecal-oral route and multiplies in the intestine.
- Mainly affects children under 5 years of age.

## Q2: Why did polio terrify everyone? (1/2) 

*(Let us go to the 1950s...)*  

- The most inexplicable in its behavior.
- 6% of the deaths in the age group 5-9 in the 50s. 
- No prevention, no protection. 
- _"You cold be good parents or bad parents, and you still had no way to protect your child."_ 
- **1894**: 18 deaths + 132 paralyzed in the U.S;  
- **1916**: 2,000 dead in New York + 6,000 dead across the country and thousands more paralyzed; and...

## Trial design

- **Solution**: Vaccine 
- **Options**: (oral) lived (attenuated) virus (OPV) VS. killed (inactivated) virus (IPV).
  - *Live-virus*: High level of long-lasting antibodies; however, cause vaccine-derived polioviruses, i.e. virus mutates into a virulent form and itself be the cause of paralytic or fatal disease.
  - *Killed-virus:* Safe, but fail to give rise to antibodies.
  
- **Vaccine Development**:
  - In the thirties, two of these were in use for a time. However, evidence that at least one of these vaccines had been responsible for cases of paralytic polio caused both to be promptly withdrawn from use.
  - In late forties, the development of vaccines was stimulated by the development of a tissue culture technique for growing polio virus. It tried to develop harmless strains from virulent ones by growing them for many generations in suitable tissue media.
  - In the early fifties, the killed-virus vaccine developed by Jonas Salk had been shown to be both safe and capable of inducing high levels of the antibody.
 - **Challenges**:
    - The incidence rate varies from season to season and area to area.
    - The vagaries of diagnosis and reporting.
  
## OPV or IPV {style="font-size: 20%;"}

- Salk vaccine (IPV) was licensed in 1955; 
- OPV was introduced by Dr. Albert Sabin 8 years later. it replaced IPV due to ease of administration and affordability. 
- A trivalent version of OPV was introduced in 1963;
- An enhanced potency IPV containing larger amounts of inactivated polioviruses was licensed in the US in 1987. 
- To help in achieving the global polio eradication, monovalent OPV type 1 vaccine has been developed (licensed in 2005). It seems to lead to greater type-specific immunity than trivalent OPV.
- Despite its effectiveness of OPV in preventing infection by wildtype polioviruses, OPV will have to be stopped because continuous use of OPV would maintain the risks of paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), and
- Re-acquisition of the neurovirulence and transmission characteristics of wild poliovirus, i.e. vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV), which can occur after the attenuated virus in OPV mutates during replication, silently occuring for a long period of time, to regain virulence. 
- Supplementary immunization activity have been conducted with either trivalent OPV (since February 2006) to control the current outbreak. The use of IPV vaccine is the only way to avoid the risk of VAPP or VDPV.

--- __1954 Field Trial__ ---

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

__Observed Control__

- _Case_: vaccination all children in the 2nd grade
- _Control_: the 1st and 3rd grade children
- _Pros_:
  - Same geographic location
  - Observed concurrently in time
- _Cons_:
  - different ages (take average)
  - uncertainty in the diagnostic process
  - bias in physician's expectations
  - selective effect of using volunteers

__Randomization + placebo control__

- Ramdomize vaccine / placebo to all 2nd grade volunteers
- Pros:
  - minimize the previously mentioned bias
  - double blind
- Cons:
  - parentsâ€™ concerns on children receiving ineffective salt solution
  - ethical issue

---__Result__---

- The most expensive medical experiment (randomized and double-blinded design) costs over 5 million dollars.

---__Was it really 90%?__ ---

_Dr. Hanley will tell you the story behind this result._ 

## [Q4: Does polio still exist? (1/4)](https://ourworldindata.org/polio)

- WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988.
- By 1999, 99% reduction of polio cases, eradicated wild poliovirus type 2, and all polioviruses from 3 of the 6 WHO regions. 
- Mid-2003, two Nigerian states suspended oral (attenuated) poliovirus vaccine use, which caused new outbreaks in 20 polio-free countries and thousands of children being paralyzed.

Question: Do you believe Vaccination With Oral Polio Vaccine Reduces COVID-19 Incidence? 

*__Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) were shown to induce non-specific protection against a broad spectrum of off-target pathogens by stimulating innate immune responses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of immunization with bivalent Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (bOPV) on the incidence of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory infections (ARIs).__*
